# Data Analysis
# What needs to be Done with the Data:
The 'Optimazation' data collected from the HR++ camera is going to be used for obtaining the f(opt) factor used in a convertion of .lm to .a files (readable onces)
This is done by, first plotting the 3D standard deviation as a function of f (i.e from 30% to 85%) then taking the minimum f value from the plot.
This f(opt) will then be ran through the PEPT algorithm to obtain .a files.
Second thing is: The convertion of the, x,y,z trajectory of the tracer to r, theta, and z, i.e from cartasian to cylindrical coordinates. 
Use the processed .a files and produce plots for comparison between theory and expiriment
